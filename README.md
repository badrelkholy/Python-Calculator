# Python-Calculator

This calculator was made all indepenedently. By independently I mean that the logic, sequence and code was all original and I did not search them up. However, I searched up how to use the try and except in general but I did not search up how to do it exactly for ZeroDivisionError and for ValueError.

This is because this is also, along with the rock-paper-scissors game, a small project that puts my skills to the test.

Hope you enjoy it.
